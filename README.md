The tutorial consists of two parts:
- #1. [HLA imputation](https://github.com/immunogenomics/HLA_analyses_tutorial/blob/main/tutorial_HLAQCImputation.ipynb) : We introduce protocols to QC genotype, perform haplotype phasing and HLA imputation. We provide useful scripts and example usage, with example genotype and reference datasets.
- #2. [HLA association and fine-mapping](https://github.com/immunogenomics/HLA_analyses_tutorial/blob/main/tutorial_association.md): We introduce various statistical methods to identify and fine-map disease-associated HLA variations. The HLA imputation results from section #1 will be used. We provide useful scripts with some example phenotype data.
